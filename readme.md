# My Minecraft Modpack Configs
This repo is for the modpack's configs and more because we are idiots and need it

## Important TO DOs
- Make a list of mods in the modpack and their versions to be able to recreate the modpack if needed (dev?)
- Backup art into a ZIP folder on Google Drive or a backup somewhere for safekeeping (dev?)
